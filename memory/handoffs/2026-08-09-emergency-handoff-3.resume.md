Resuming session via acos-eternity-protocol auto-resume.

CONTEXT HANDOFF: Read `/Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/ACOS 3.0/memory/handoffs/2026-08-09-emergency-handoff-3.yaml` for full session state.

Quick summary:
- Working on: R2P EPIC-001 build in "/Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P" (LOCAL-ONLY repo, NEVER push). Pairs 1-7 of 24 SEALED. Pair 8 (DEV/QA-001-003-02 "Opposing-order netting") is one gate from seal: QA PASS sustained (f691e83), holdout run 2 9/9 both findings RESOLVED (9cd618e, HEAD, tree clean). ADR-006 authored status proposed. Eden L3 active.
- Last action: holdout run 2 evidence commit 9cd618e verified on disk.
- Next step: MUTATION GATE for pair 8 — rm -rf .stryker-tmp; pnpm run test:mutation (single process, repo untouched during, ~10 min); REQUIRED: netting.ts OWN per-file score >= 70 (PRD §16.7 changed-material bar, pair-7 precedent: aggregate alone insufficient — capital-budget.ts needed 64.76 -> 93.25 via tests-only rev); then TESTRUN evidence + manifest entry in EVB-PAIR-001-003-02, then SEAL pair 8 (both slice yamls -> closed, EVB-PAIR + EVB-HLD sealed with bundle_sha256 via find|sort|xargs shasum excluding manifest.yaml, all 4 gates exit 0 first). Then pair 9 (DEV-001-003-03) -> stories 004-008 -> epic close ratification packet.
- Blockers: none hard. Gotchas: agents stall after interim narration (SendMessage "continue in ONE pass"); agents can HANG pre-mutation-gate (3x this session — TaskStop + SendMessage-resume; orchestrator may run the gate itself with actor disclosure, pair-7 TESTRUN-31 precedent); suite baseline 1595; scoped git adds; qa-private/ custodian-only; holdout findings ONLY from EVB-HLD manifest; TypeScript only ZERO python3 in R2P; no timeout/gtimeout.

GOALS TO CARRY FORWARD — /clear does not keep these; you must restart them
yourself, as your very first action, before anything else:

  - AUTOPILOT GOAL was active. Run this first (from the ACOS 3.0 dir):
      python3 .claude/scripts/autopilot-activate.py on "Complete the R2P project in /Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P to the end-state defined by docs/PRD_v0.4.txt: first finish EPIC-001 (all 24 DEV/QA pairs through the adversarial cycle - DEV, QA, holdout, orchestrator seal - then EVB-STORY bundles x8, 4-reviewer swarm review, EVB-EPIC-001, close packet), then plan and execute each subsequent PRD phase as new epics under the same adversarial cycle with sealed evidence throughout. At every epic close, present the ratification packet (ADRs, finding dispositions, disclosure queue) to Zee and continue non-dependent work (e.g. planning the next epic) while awaiting his decision. Never self-approve; never treat silence as approval; never push (local-only repo). Re-derive current position from repo state (planning/, git log) at each iteration." --goal-file /Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P/docs/PRD_v0.4.txt --max-iter 1000

IMPORTANT: do not assume progress matches what any summary above says. Go
verify the REAL current state yourself first (git log in R2P, slice yamls,
evidence manifests) before continuing the work. A freshly cleared chat has no
memory of exactly how much was already done — trust the real state on disk,
not a remembered number.

This prompt was auto-injected after /clear ran. The user has not typed anything
since. Read the handoff document and continue the prior work seamlessly.

**Drift check:** if `git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD` no longer equals `14343bddc10a`, or the working tree is dirty, RECONCILE from `git log` / `git status` / `git diff` before trusting any "completed / all committed" claim in the handoff above. (This session learned the hard way: a 2026-06-24 resume arrived 3 commits + 1 uncommitted method stale.)
