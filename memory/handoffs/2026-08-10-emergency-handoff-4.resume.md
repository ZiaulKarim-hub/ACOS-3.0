Resuming session via acos-eternity-protocol auto-resume.

CONTEXT HANDOFF: Read `memory/handoffs/2026-08-10-emergency-handoff-4.yaml` for full session state.

Quick summary:
- Working on: Logo Forge ribbon, in a SEPARATE repo at ~/.claude/skills
  (app at ~/.claude/skills/acos-logo-forge/app). NOT the ACOS 3.0 repo you are
  cd'd into. This session made zero edits in ACOS 3.0.
- Last action: merged Font + Paragraph into one #textGroup at the right end of
  the Home tab, icons only, with a corner launcher (.rgll -> #textMore) for the
  six less-used commands and one #txtAlignB button opening #alignPop for the
  four alignment buttons. #txtGrow/#txtShrink deleted outright. Home tab is now
  1019px wide, down from 1328px originally. Screenshots were delivered.
- Test state: ribbon-test.ts 243/243 exit 0; all ten suites "0 non-zero" with
  zero FAIL lines; audit.ts 0 findings; a bespoke verify-ribbon.ts 32/32.
- Next step: ASK whether to commit. Two files are uncommitted in ~/.claude/skills
  (acos-logo-forge/app/editor.html and ribbon-test.ts, 724 insertions,
  89 deletions). Last time Zee chose "Logo Forge only", local commit, NO push.
  Do NOT commit without asking.
- Blockers: none. He may also reply to the screenshots with more layout changes.

READ THE HANDOFF'S `handoff_provenance_caveat` BLOCK FIRST. That handoff was
written by the MAIN session, not handoff-agent — the agent stalled after writing
a 496-byte stub, and that stub would have passed the eternity protocol's own
Step 1 freshness guard. The gap is written up in the handoff with a suggested fix.

YOUR LAST MESSAGE BEFORE THIS RESET (exact words, not a paraphrase):

  1. Clipboard stays at far left.
2. delete
3. do
4. Do icons only (have the font name a wide icon like it looks right now, for others add them below in two rows. Since paragrpah will only have two icons, maybe combine font and paragraph to one tool group and let me see how it all looks.

That message was ANSWERED and ACTED ON in full — the merged Text group is built,
tested and screenshotted. Do not rebuild it. Verify against the real state on
disk before doing anything, then wait for his reaction to the screenshots.

NO GOAL IS ACTIVE. No autopilot sentinel and no /goal condition were found, so
nothing needs re-arming. A shape-library goal from much earlier in this session
was retired by Zee's own choice ("Leave it off") — do not resume it.

NEVER touch the live server on port 8815 (PID 43272 at reset time) — it is Zee's
own. Test servers use 8816 / 8817 / 8818 / 8819. lsof first, every time.

IMPORTANT: do not assume progress matches what any summary above says. Verify the
REAL current state on disk first — re-read git status in ~/.claude/skills, re-run
the suites if a claim matters — before continuing.

**Drift check:** if `git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD` no longer equals `fa1676201ad1`, or the working tree is dirty, RECONCILE from `git log` / `git status` / `git diff` before trusting any "completed / all committed" claim in the handoff above. (This session learned the hard way: a 2026-06-24 resume arrived 3 commits + 1 uncommitted method stale.)
