Resuming session via acos-eternity-protocol auto-resume.

CONTEXT HANDOFF: Read `memory/handoffs/2026-08-12-emergency-handoff-5.yaml` for full session state.

Quick summary:
- Working on: Fixing the Eternity Protocol's keystroke-injection failure — when a cmux pane is busy, the typed command's Enter is swallowed and the reset never fires, which has run several sessions (most recently Research to Portfolio) out of context.
- Last action: Three research probes returned 42 cited claims. All converged: abandon keystroke injection. Claude Code already self-compacts on a token threshold with zero keystrokes; PreCompact fires on auto-compaction too (trigger field = "auto"), so the handoff can still be written first; subagents survive compaction (separate transcript files).
- Next step: Get Zee's yes/no on "Want me to build this?" — do NOT re-derive the research. The proposed change: (1) set autoCompactEnabled: true and autoCompactWindow to match the current threshold in /Users/zee/.claude/settings.json:126, (2) add a PreCompact hook (none registered today) that writes the ACOS handoff before compaction, (3) leave the SessionStart(compact) resume as-is, (4) retire the keystroke-injection path so both do not fire.
- Blockers: One genuinely undocumented gap — whether native auto-compact WAITS for still-running background subagents. Separate transcript files make "it does not wait" the reasonable inference, but it is an inference. Needs a live test here, not more searching.

Also earlier this session (already DONE, do not redo): three Eternity Protocol defects were fixed and tested (49-54 checks, exit 0) in eternity-cmux-inpane.sh and eternity-cmux-resume-inpane.sh — the order barrier (.awaiting-resume), the resume verify-and-retry (Priority 1.5, transcript is the authority), and the manual-fire double-fire guard (_fire_in_flight compares the newest /acos-eternity-protocol against the newest /compact). Those files are NOT in git. Backups in bin/.backup-2026-08-11/.

STANDING RULE (saved this session): always name sessions by their sidebar name ("Research to Portfolio", "Insightia"), never by a session id like d72f5b72.

YOUR LAST MESSAGE BEFORE THIS RESET (exact words, not a paraphrase):

  Yeah, mailbox is a bad idea, also I can't change the permission setting to have them appear on my window, that will beat the whole purpose of eternity protocol as the system will keep bugging me for permission and not work autonomously.
Also, as far as I know, when the helpers are running, enter doesn't help the command reach claude, so having sever enter presees are not going to help. Can you figure out how this problem can be solved? /research 2

If this looks like it's still an open question — answer it directly, first.
But check it's not already answered before diving in: real work may have
happened, and been completed, between when this was typed and when this
reset fired. Verify against the real state on disk, don't assume this is
still pending just because it's the last thing you see here.

IMPORTANT: do not assume progress matches what any summary above says. Go
verify the REAL current state yourself first before continuing the work.

This prompt was auto-injected after a reset ran. The user has not typed
anything since. Read the handoff document and continue the prior work
seamlessly.

**Drift check:** if `git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD` no longer equals `fa1676201ad1`, or the working tree is dirty, RECONCILE from `git log` / `git status` / `git diff` before trusting any "completed / all committed" claim in the handoff above. (This session learned the hard way: a 2026-06-24 resume arrived 3 commits + 1 uncommitted method stale.)
