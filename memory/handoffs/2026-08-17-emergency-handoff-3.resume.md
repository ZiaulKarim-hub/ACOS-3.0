Resuming session via acos-eternity-protocol auto-resume.

CONTEXT HANDOFF: Read `/Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/ACOS 3.0/memory/handoffs/2026-08-17-emergency-handoff-3.yaml` IN FULL before acting. Verified this fire: 21354 bytes, 16 keys, 0 stub markers, content-checked (4614218, second clock, 15_000, ff46201, WHAT-R2P-IS, LOCAL-ONLY all present). Agent confidence: HIGH, 16 sources.

Quick summary:
- Working on: R2P at `/Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P`. LOCAL-ONLY, NO git remote — NEVER push. Transcript is filed under ACOS 3.0; do not mis-scope.
- THE PIVOTAL EVENT: Zee said he did NOT write R2P's PRD and does not know what R2P is. My glossing had been defining terms he knew and skipping the ones he did not. Two plain-language docs answer it: docs/WHAT-R2P-IS-plain-language.html (17fb1c1) and docs/THE-12-OPEN-DECISIONS-plain-language.html (ff46201). Standing memory written: feedback_define_domain_words_not_code_words. His verdict: "It makes way more sense now." ORIENT BEFORE EVERY RULING; gloss DOMAIN words (sleeve, basis risk, netting), not the code words he already knows.
- Last actions: nine scaffold files got tests, QA PASS 20/20, 68/68 mutants killed (bfbbdf1). Clock dials chosen: timeoutMS 120000 + timeoutFactor 1.6 (4614218). Q2/Q3/Q4 ruled A/A/A (4c3630e). OBS-MG26 (fd487ae) corrected me twice: identity now 100.00/100.00, killed 19 / timeout 0, spread 0.00 across 13 runs, and a separation run at the OLD 5000/1.5 clock proved the TESTS did it, not the clock — so my prediction that identity would trip Q4's spread rule is WITHDRAWN.
- Next step: answer Zee's message below, then take the SECOND CLOCK ruling, then the 12 packet decisions.
- Blockers: (1) THE SECOND CLOCK — vitest.config.ts:10 `testTimeout: 15_000` fires before Stryker's ruled 120000 on a hanging test, making the chosen budget unreachable for that class. Posed as "raise it" or "leave it" — NOT a lettered option, and deliberately left unassigned when Zee answered "A A A". Provisional inference from runner source + vitest docs; no Stryker doc states it. (2) The 12 open packet decisions (14 total, 2 ruled — I had wrongly said ten). (3) Q2's measurement returned but did NOT resolve Q2: a concurrency still needs choosing, and needs a file that actually wobbles. PREREG-GATE-002 is NOT frozen; no median-protocol run may be read as a verdict until (1) and (3) land.

YOUR LAST MESSAGE BEFORE THIS RESET (exact words, not a paraphrase):

  It makes way more sense now. What is the next decision?

I answered: the second clock, plus a correction that 12 of the 14 packet items remain, not ten. Check whether he has since ruled it before re-asking.

GOALS TO CARRY FORWARD — a reset does not keep these; restart as your very first action:
  - AUTOPILOT GOAL was active (iteration 9, max 1000). Run this first:
      python3 .claude/scripts/autopilot-activate.py on "Complete the R2P project in /Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P to the end-state defined by docs/PRD_v0.4.txt: first finish EPIC-001 (all 24 DEV/QA pairs through the adversarial cycle - DEV, QA, holdout, orchestrator seal - then EVB-STORY bundles x8, 4-reviewer swarm review, EVB-EPIC-001, close packet), then plan and execute each subsequent PRD phase as new epics under the same adversarial cycle with sealed evidence throughout. At every epic close, present the ratification packet (ADRs, finding dispositions, disclosure queue) to Zee and continue non-dependent work (e.g. planning the next epic) while awaiting his decision. Never self-approve; never treat silence as approval; never push (local-only repo). Re-derive current position from repo state (planning/, git log) at each iteration." --goal-file "/Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P/docs/PRD_v0.4.txt" --max-iter 1000

STANDING CONSTRAINTS: AP-06 never weaken a test/invariant/tolerance. AP-07 no agent approves, seals, closes or ratifies; silence is never approval. Zee IS the human gate ("Ben" is the PRD's role name). Records are ADDITIVE — supersede with a sibling, never edit. NEVER AskUserQuestion for a ruling while autopilot is active (OBS-AP1 forges it). Forbidden score levers: project-wide excludedMutations, `// Stryker disable` except per-site for a demonstrated equivalent with a written reason, narrowed mutate globs, weakened tests, ignoreStatic. Eden level 4.

IMPORTANT: do not assume progress matches any summary above. Verify the REAL state on disk first (R2P git log, planning/evidence/EVB-EPIC-001/close-packet/) before continuing.

**Drift check:** if `git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD` no longer equals `66b7b71a11f2`, or the working tree is dirty, RECONCILE from `git log` / `git status` / `git diff` before trusting any "completed / all committed" claim in the handoff above. (This session learned the hard way: a 2026-06-24 resume arrived 3 commits + 1 uncommitted method stale.)
