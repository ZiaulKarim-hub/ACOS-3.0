Resuming session via acos-eternity-protocol auto-resume.

CONTEXT HANDOFF: Read `/Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/ACOS 3.0/memory/handoffs/2026-08-17-emergency-handoff.yaml` IN FULL before acting. Verified fresh and enriched this fire (16604 bytes, 16 keys, no stub marker).

Quick summary:
- Working on: R2P at `/Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P`. LOCAL-ONLY, NO git remote at all — NEVER push. The transcript is filed under ACOS 3.0; do not let that mis-scope the work.
- Last action: EPIC-001 mutation gate CLOSED OUT. All six sub-70 files clear BOTH bars. Ratification packet built (1413aca). Timeout experiment finished (8968b00).
- Next step: resume walking Zee through the 14 rulings ONE AT A TIME, starting at MG21-R1 (options A/B/C). Plain reply text — NEVER AskUserQuestion (OBS-AP1: autopilot auto-answers it by picking "(Recommended)", which forges a human ruling).
- Blockers: 14 rulings await Zee. Two tier-1 gate the rest — MG21-R1 and MG21-R2. Index: `planning/evidence/EVB-EPIC-001/close-packet/RATIFICATION-PACKET-EPIC-001.yaml`.

NAMING, standing as of 2026-08-17: **Zee IS the human gate.** "Ben" in PRD §18.3 is the ROLE name, not a third party. Records carrying `owner: Ben` mean Zee. New records use `owner: Zee`. Records are ADDITIVE — never edit prior text.

NO stryker run is live. The gate finished (RUN_EXIT=0, 8h 44m); a later single-file run also finished. Tree restored, zero live `// @ts-nocheck`. Any older handoff warning that a run is live is STALE — do not carry it forward.

YOUR LAST MESSAGE BEFORE THIS RESET (exact words, not a paraphrase):

  I don't know about the blockers that are stuck for my approval (from now on instead of Ben, refer me as Zee). Give me on of those situations at a time and tell me what i need to approve on one at a time.

This is STILL OPEN. Zee was given decision 1 of 14 (MG21-R1: does the killed-only bar bind — A, B or C) and has NOT answered. Do not re-ask what he already answered; verify against the ratification packet first.

GOALS TO CARRY FORWARD — a reset does not keep these; restart them yourself, first action, before anything else:

  - AUTOPILOT GOAL was active. Run this first:
      python3 .claude/scripts/autopilot-activate.py on "Complete the R2P project in /Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P to the end-state defined by docs/PRD_v0.4.txt: first finish EPIC-001 (all 24 DEV/QA pairs through the adversarial cycle - DEV, QA, holdout, orchestrator seal - then EVB-STORY bundles x8, 4-reviewer swarm review, EVB-EPIC-001, close packet), then plan and execute each subsequent PRD phase as new epics under the same adversarial cycle with sealed evidence throughout. At every epic close, present the ratification packet (ADRs, finding dispositions, disclosure queue) to Zee and continue non-dependent work (e.g. planning the next epic) while awaiting his decision. Never self-approve; never treat silence as approval; never push (local-only repo). Re-derive current position from repo state (planning/, git log) at each iteration." --goal-file /Users/zee/Documents/Vibe Coding/R2P/docs/PRD_v0.4.txt --max-iter 1000

IMPORTANT: do not assume progress matches any summary above. Verify the REAL state on disk first (git log in R2P, the close-packet directory, the ratification packet) before continuing.

This prompt was auto-injected after a reset. Zee has not typed anything since. Read the handoff and continue.

**Drift check:** if `git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD` no longer equals `ee8be86bc715`, or the working tree is dirty, RECONCILE from `git log` / `git status` / `git diff` before trusting any "completed / all committed" claim in the handoff above. (This session learned the hard way: a 2026-06-24 resume arrived 3 commits + 1 uncommitted method stale.)
